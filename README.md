I created this tool because I didn't want to automate figuring out my persona fusions with a full-fledged calculator (many calculators already exist if you need one), but I still wanted something a little bit more sophisticated than finding everything on the tables from the official manuals.

This is still something of a work-in-progress, so here are some things I'd still like to do:

- Fancy CSS for the Persona 5 and Persona 5 Royal pages
- When triangle fusion is hidden or unavailable, provide an option to make the bottom half of the table mirror the top half
- Rewrite the "How Triangle Fusion Works" section for clarity
